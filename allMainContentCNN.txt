Cop pulled over by driver for speeding Story highlights EDITOR'S NOTE: This story contains offensive language and may not be suitable for all audiences. The texts were discovered as part of a probe into a sexual assault allegation This is the second time SFPD has been the subject of a racist texting scandal Some texts referenced President Obama and LeBron James (CNN) "I hate that beaner," one text reads, "but I think the nig is worse." "Indian ppl are disgusting," proclaims another. "Burn down walgreens and kill the bums," a third message states. These and numerous other racist and homophobic text messages were allegedly sent by a San Francisco police officer at the center of an ongoing scandal that is the most recent disturbing revelation for the beleaguered SFPD. Justice Department to investigate San Francisco police Read More CNN has exclusively obtained a list of dozens of offensive texts sent to and from Officer Jason Lai. The content has not been previously disclosed. The list is not a full history of his texts. Lai resigned from the department earlier this month, according to a police spokesman. Don Nobles, Lai's attorney, said the texts were "not reflective of who he is" and that "there is no evidence he carried out any of those sentiments as an officer." "He was well liked and well loved on his beat," he said of the six-year-veteran. The texts were seized from Officer Jason Lai's personal phone. He's resigned from the department. Second scandal in as many years Nobles said the texts were seized from Lai's personal phone and had been exchanged with some of his closest friends on the police force, as well as with people he had befriended on his beat. "It's hard to say any of those things in context," the lawyer said, "but there is context to it." It marks the second time in as many years that the SFPD has been the subject of a racist texting scandal and could undermine Chief Greg Suhr's assertion that the problem is limited to a relative handful of officers and not part a broader cultural problem within the ranks, as critics contend. 2015 poll: 1 in 5 African Americans report 'unfair' dealings with police in last month Suhr said Monday that he has no tolerance for biased officers and takes "swift and severe" action when they come to his attention. He said he is working to get the SFPD to "a better place." "We work for the community," Suhr said. "We work for everybody and when somebody demonstrates that they have this reprehensible character trait, we need to cut them from the body." Lai allegedly sent dozens of racist and homophobic texts. Texts reference President Obama, LeBron James In addition to disparaging blacks, Hispanics and Indians, Lai used coded language to talk about gay officers, according to a source, and made a blanket statement impugning residents of the city's largely minority and low-income Tenderloin district. "They're all drug dealers in the TL," his text stated. The officer also referred to a draft of an official incident report as "a story I wrote today." The messages, sent in 2014 and 2015, were discovered as part of an SFPD probe into a sexual assault allegation against Lai made by a woman last year. Prosecutors declined to file rape charges in the case, citing insufficient evidence. Chicago PD accused of institutional racism Lai has since been charged with multiple misdemeanor counts of illegally accessing DMV computers for a non-official purpose. He is scheduled to be arraigned on May 3rd. Prosecutors recently turned over the text messages to the San Francisco Public Defender's office, which is representing a defendant in a case in which Lai was involved. Evidence of biased attitudes could be used to undermine the officer's credibility and result in cases being dismissed. San Francisco Public Defender Jeff Adachi provided the texts to CNN at the request of reporters. In the messages, Lai makes a disparaging joke about President Obama and says he hates basketball player LeBron James. "F--- that nig," he says. Such language could add to ongoing tension between the police and members of San Francisco's African American community, some of whom have called for Suhr to resign in the wake of the controversial police killing of a black man armed with a knife last December. The shooting remains under investigation. Fast facts: Controversial police encounters Lai, who was identified as Chinese by his attorney, makes several references to "hock gwai," apparently a misspelled reference to the Cantonese "hak gwai," a derogatory phrase for African Americans. In a series of texts sent last June he describes an incident involving a "bunch of hock gwais shooting each other." "Sprained my ankle over these barbarians," he says. One of the suspects "went to the hospital after he got shot lol," the officer texted. "Too bad none of them died," he added. "One less to worry about." The texts disparaged against blacks, Hispanics, Indians, gays and poor people. More than one officer involved In another exchange referencing African Americans, Lai wrote: "They're like a pack [of] wild animals on the loose." The exchange happened during a night of civil unrest in Baltimore following the death of Freddie Gray . Gray, an African American, died after suffering head and neck injuries in the back of a police van. Baltimore faces its 'original sin' a year after riots Lai used coded language to describe an encounter with a sergeant at the department's Taraval station. "Passive aggressive 528," he wrote, using the numeric code for a fire call. The number is used to describe gay officers as "flames or flaming," according to the source. The names of most of the people trading texts with Lai are blacked out or listed as "unknown" in the documents obtained by CNN. Opinion: Racism deeply embedded in our psyche At least two exchanges appear to involve one or more police officers. In one exchange, Lai and a fellow texter discuss running into one another at a police station and dealing with a "528" sergeant. In another, a person texting Lai described being in an "on-duty" accident that occurred in 2015. "Some dumb Asian chick driving for Uber didn't look and changed lanes right into my car," the texter said. Three of four officers implicated in the texting scandal with Lai are no longer with the department, said Officer Albie Esparza, a police spokesman. A fourth officer is facing disciplinary charges, Esparza said. "We're going to be better served without them," Suhr said. Texts discovered by accident The SFPD's first texting scandal occurred last year when a federal prosecutor filed court papers detailing racist and homophobic texts made by former SFPD Sgt. Ian Furminger, one of three officers convicted of stealing money and drugs from the residents of low-rent Tenderloin hotels. The texts were made public in support of a motion to put Furminger in jail in advance of his then-impending prison sentence. They were discovered as part of a federal corruption probe into the officers. Fourteen officers, including a captain, were implicated in sending or receiving such texts. Suhr attempted to fire eight of those officers, but was barred from doing so after a judge determined he waited too long to initiate disciplinary proceedings. The city has appealed the judge's decision. Public Defender Adachi, whose office released hotel surveillance footage of Furminger and other officers' alleged crimes on YouTube, prompting the federal investigation, noted that text messages discovered in that case—and in Lai's—were discovered by accident. Adachi said it made him wonder what other SFPD officers are texting about that has not come to light because they've yet to be accused of a crime. "What are the chances of two officers being arrested...and there's racists texts on [their phones]?" he said. "I don't know what the odds would be in Vegas." Singled out officer 'extremely hurt' Yulanda Williams, an African American sergeant who was singled out by name and called a racial slur in the first texting scandal, said she was "extremely hurt" by what happened. "It made me wonder what must I do as a black woman to prove that I'm worthy of wearing the same blue uniform" as her fellow officers, she said. Williams, president of a minority police officers' association called Officers for Justice, said she was concerned not only for herself. "I was also concerned that it could hinder our ability to be able to hire officers of color when they see and hear of others being treated that way," she told CNN in a recent interview. Without revealing the contents of the texts, San Francisco District Attorney George Gascon announced last last month that a new round of racist and homophobic messages had been discovered as part of the sexual assault probe of Lai. The first texting scandal prompted a review of some 1,600 cases for evidence of biased policing by the 14 officers implicated, Gascon said. Ultimately, 13 cases were dismissed due to concerns about the officers. 'A good old boys network' The current texting investigation stemming from Lai's case involves several other officers, including a lieutenant. It could result in hundreds more cases being reviewed, Gascon said. Like Adachi, Gascon stressed the accidental nature of the discovery of the texts in both cases. He also accused the police department of being slow to address the problem in both instances. In an interview with CNN last week, Gascon said he has concluded two things about the police department he once ran. "No. 1: There's a substantial number of people within the organization that are racist," he said. "And No. 2: There's a culture that has allowed those people to thrive and survive and even promote within that environment." Suhr said he did not want to "get into it" with Gascon who he succeeded as chief, but he noted that "every one of these officers I've contended with were there when he was the chief of police." Gascon likened the leadership of the SFPD's union to police in Alabama and Mississippi in the 1950s. "They would probably feel right at home," he said. "It's a good old boys network that does everything they can to protect the status quo." Martin Halloran, president of the San Francisco Police Officers Association, did not return a call or email seeking comment. Gascon, who in addition to serving as the SFPD chief for more than a year, spent most of his career at the LAPD -- a department that has seen its own share of scandal. Even after decades in law enforcement, Gascon said, he was stunned by the contents of the text messages he's read. "I never in a million years would have dreamt that those kind of conversations would go on between San Francisco police officers," he said. He said officers should not be allowed to engage in such talk, even in private. "I would say OK if you're a plumber, if you're a carpenter," he said. "But if you're somebody that actually gets to put people in jail or in worst case conditions actually take somebody's life from them, and do so lawfully, you don't get to be a racist." Adachi, the public defender, said he was concerned that a perceived lack of accountability could lead officers to believe there are no consequences for misconduct in the SFPD. 'R U READING THIS IA?' Lai sent some of his texts after the first scandal had made headlines. He discussed what investigators would be able to find with a search warrant and suggested that deleting an app could cover his tracks. At one point he made what appeared to be a joking reference to being the subject of an internal affairs investigation. "R U READING THIS IA?" he texted. Then, in August of 2015, as investigators obtained search warrants in pursuit of the sexual assault investigation, Lai sent this ominous message to an unknown recipient: "This is my drop phone," Lai wrote, borrowing a term drug dealers used to describe disposable phones for conducting illicit business. "Don't contact me or answer any calls/texts from my normal cell until further," the text said. &lt;div class="banner" id="cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0_banner"&gt;&lt;span id="cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0" class="_fwph"&gt;&lt;form id="_fw_form_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0" style="display:none"&gt;&lt;input type="hidden" name="_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0" id="_fw_input_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0" value="ptgt=s;envp=g_js;w=300;h=250;slau=300x250_sync;adUnit=300x250_sync"&gt;&lt;/form&gt;&lt;span id="_fw_container_cnn_300x250_sync_freewheel-rail_0" class="cn-shingle__ad"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Billy Paul, 'Me and Mrs. Jones' singer, dead at 80 By Melissa Gray, CNN Updated 11:14 AM ET, Tue April 26, 2016 Billy Paul speaks at the Pre-Grammy Party at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills, California in 2008. Story highlights Paul won a Grammy for the song in 1972 The song's lush strings were typical of the Philadelphia soul sound (CNN) Billy Paul, the Grammy-winning soul singer of the 1970s hit "Me and Mrs. Jones," has died, a statement on his official website said. He was 80. Paul died at home Sunday after a "serious medical condition," the statement read. The song about an affair with the mysterious "Mrs. Jones" reached No. 1 and earned Paul the Grammy for Best Male R;B Vocal Performance in 1972. The song -- with Paul earnestly stuttering "Mrs., Mrs. Jones, Mrs. Jones" -- was about an illicit romance with a woman at a cafe. Even though "we both know that it's wrong," he sang, they would see each other tomorrow at "the same place, the same time." The song's sophisticated arrangement with lush strings was the signature sound of Philadelphia International Records, known as the Motown of the '70s. It was the same label behind Teddy Pendergrass' "Come Go With Me" and the O'Jays' "Love Train." 50 photos: People we've lost in 2016 A look back at people who died in 2016 .

Opinion: Black police officer: I live in two worlds Terms such as "driving while black" and "walking while black" have been coined, with studies showing that blacks are pulled over, questioned or arrested by police at a disproportionately higher rate than white Americans. A new poll by CNN and the Kaiser Family Foundation gets to the heart of how prevalent these types of experiences are: 1 out of 5 African-Americans said they were treated unfairly because of their race in dealings with the police in the past 30 days. By comparison, only 3% of whites said they'd been treated unfairly, according to the poll. Read More That's 19% of African Americans nationwide.

Podair said the finding suggests many encounters between African-Americans and police have "the potential to end very badly -- with either an unfair arrest or a violent assault or even death." He pointed to the deaths of Freddie Gray and Eric Garner in Baltimore and New York while in police custody. And then there's Walter Scott, who was shot and killed by an officer in North Charleston, South Carolina. Controversial police encounters Making the 1-in-5 statistic even more complicated, Podair said, is the fact that there are more African-American police officers than ever before. "You would think that relations would be getting better," he said. "There is some sort of huge perceptual chasm between the police and the policed in most American cities," Podair said. 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race 26 photos: In the news: Conversations about race Harvard University police said they were investigating a possible hate crime at the law school after someone covered portraits of black faculty members in tape, according to university officials.

Hide Caption 26 of 26 "When you get that kind of perceptual gulf -- when you're looking at the same incident and you're interpreting it in different ways -- that's a recipe for total division and complete disunity in our society." Andra Gillespie, a political scientist and associate professor at Emory University, agreed. She said the poll result "reflects the fact that we're in a moment right now where police and minority communities, particularly African-American communities, are tense." Is racism on the rise? More in U.S. say it's a 'big problem,' CNN/KFF poll finds "As a society, we're going to have to figure out a way to bridge the divide and have a dialogue between these two groups, so that people can get along and so that, honestly, our institutions work." Black communities understand the vital role police play in society, Gillespie said, but something has to be done to address the long-standing discrimination blacks have faced. The CNN/KFF poll 5 key findings About the poll Full results (PDF) "What people want is they want to think the police are looking at them primarily as people to protect and not as enemies to corral," Gillespie said. Gillespie also said Americans need to understand that the grievances expressed within the black community are real. The events over the past two years, from Ferguson to Baltimore to North Charleston, have begun to change that dialogue, she said, with an increasingly number of whites acknowledging that blacks are treated unfairly by the criminal justice system. Opinion: What whites don't know about racism In the CNN/KFF poll , 56% of Americans -- including 48% of whites -- said they think the system favors whites over blacks. That number is much higher -- 86% -- among African-Americans. The poll showed similar percentages when participants were asked whether the criminal justice system favors whites over Hispanics. The poll also offered insight into incidents in which unarmed blacks have been hurt or killed by police -- and the protests that have followed. A large majority of blacks -- 70% -- said the race of the officer involved would play a major role in whether the officer is charged with a crime. Only 35% of whites said the officer's race would play a major role.

A similar disparity was found when it came to the race of the prosecutor handling the case: 58% of blacks said it would play a major role compared with 25% of whites. Race and Reality in America: Five key findings However, large majorities of blacks (72%) and whites (80%) said having a dashcam, body camera or cell phone video of the incident would play a major role in whether the officer was charged. When asked what fueled protests following such incidents, blacks (84%) and whites (67%) both pointed to anger over the treatment of blacks by police as the leading major reason. Somewhat smaller percentages said other factors were major reasons: -- A desire for blacks to feel like they are being treated fairly (81% of blacks and 63% of whites) -- The way government officials handled those incidents (73% of blacks and 59% of whites) -- Poverty and lack of opportunities in some neighborhoods (61% of blacks and 51% of whites) A majority of blacks (89%) and whites (66%) also agreed that the federal government has a responsibility to make sure police and courts treat whites and minorities equally. Overall, 49% of Americans said racism is a big problem in our society today, up from 28% in 2011 and somewhat higher than the 41% in a 1995 survey conducted on the heels of the Million Man March. Opinion: Racism is so deeply embedded in our psyche The percentage is significantly higher among African-Americans: 66% said racism is a big problem today, up from 50% four years ago but about the same compared with 68% in 1995. But the most glaring result from the poll, experts said, was the 1 in 5 blacks who said they were treated unfairly by police in the last month. Graham Holt is a criminal defense attorney in Greensboro, North Carolina. He said the results don't surprise him. "I'm in the courthouse and criminal courtrooms Monday through Friday. Every single day, there are thousands of black people in those courtrooms and a handful of white people," he said. "One reason the system allows this to happen to black people is because people don't listen when a black person complains about the police." "This is the story, man. I can't think of anything more important in America right now," he said. "It's genocide. They've already taken out an entire generation of black men [through incarceration]."

Scales and his younger brother Devin were pulled over by police in May 2013 for minor infractions; Scales said he was Tased by an officer. The following summer, the brothers were stopped and questioned as they walked to the store to buy groceries for their grandmother. "Get out of the street, you morons," the officer said, according to Scales. Scales soon was face first on the ground getting handcuffed. Unlike their first encounter, this time his brother had a video camera. Devin recorded the incident on his cell phone. It provided proof that what might seem like an outlandish tale of a black man being arrested for walking down the street really happened. Who will you blame once Obama's gone? "He asked for my ID; I gave him my ID," Rufus Scales said in the video while on the ground, the officer next to him. "I don't know where you live. All I know is you're out in the middle of the road," the officer responded. "You cannot sit here and run your mouth and start cursing out in the middle of the street." The two brothers were arrested on charges of impeding traffic. Rufus Scales also was charged with resisting arrest and public intoxication. He admitted cursing but denies being intoxicated. The charges were eventually dropped after the brothers filed a complaint -- the video serving as a smoking gun. The city apologized. Holt said the incident, unfortunately, is all too common for African-Americans. "I see black people getting pulled over and searched all the time," he said. "You hardly ever see the cops searching white people. "If that happened to two white young men, heads would roll." The CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll was conducted August 25-October 3 among a random national sample of 1,951 adults, including 501 black respondents and 500 Hispanic respondents.

This poll was jointly developed and analyzed by CNN and staff at the Kaiser Family Foundation.

MUST WATCH Anti-LGBT advocate: Transgender bill is about culture 03:43 Story highlights GOP lawmaker Paul Stam: This law is about protecting privacy, not discrimination Transgender advocate Candis Cox: This is no different than the South's Jim Crow laws (CNN) Paul Stam and Candis Cox are on opposite sides of the debate over a controversial new transgender law that's turning national attention toward North Carolina. To Stam, a Republican state lawmaker who sponsored the measure, it's a necessary step that stops anyone from getting special rights and one city from dictating policies that should be decided by the state. To Cox, a transgender woman and advocate, it's a dangerous and discriminatory measure that puts her and tens of thousands of others at risk. In separate interviews with CNN's Nick Valencia on Sunday, Stam and Cox shared their thoughts on a number of issues raised by the Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act , which puts in place a statewide policy that bans individuals from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex . Here's a look at how they weighed in on several aspects of the new law: About whether it's discriminatory... Read More Stam : "The law did not change the policy on discrimination an appreciable extent between two weeks ago and today. What they're really complaining about is that we have not become like the 17 other states that have put in special rights for them. ... We're trying to protect the reasonable expectations of privacy of 99.9% of our citizens, who think when they're going into a restroom or a changing room or a locker room, that they will be private." Cox : "This law affects us because it puts us in danger, and it's open discrimination. It's no different than the Jim Crow laws that we had here in the South. There are many Americans who are alive today and were alive with some of those laws before we passed the Civil Rights bill. This law is literally the same thing. And if we didn't find that acceptable, this is not acceptable. It doesn't matter who it's towards. Discrimination is not acceptable." Candis Cox, a transgender woman and activist, says North Carolina's new law is no different than Jim Crow laws that legalized racial segregation and discrimination in the South. About the special session legislators called to pass it... Snapshot: North Carolina's transgender law Name : Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act When it passed : March 23 Who voted for it : The bill passed the state House 82-26 and the state Senate 32-0 , with Senate Democrats walking out and not voting in protest. What it does : The new law puts in place a statewide policy that bans individuals from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex. It also stops cities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender people. What happens next : A federal lawsuit has been filed over the measure . The state's attorney general says he won't defend it in court. But in the court of public opinion, Gov. Pat McCrory and other supporters of the measure have staunchly stood behind it, saying it's about protecting privacy. Stam : "For 180 years, North Carolina has had the constitutional public policy that issues of labor and trade would be decided on a statewide basis instead of locally. And so, without any legal authority whatsoever, Charlotte decided to go against that (by passing an ordinance in February that said transgender residents could use the restroom of the gender they identify with). Charlotte had no authority to do its ordinance, but yet was threatening tens of thousands of businesses with fines and even minor punishments if they didn't comply. ... They were threatening 23,000 businesses and nonprofits, including churches, with fines and minor other punishments if they didn't conform to that policy." Cox : "They spent $40,000 (to have a special session). ... Well, I'm glad that they're paying that much attention (to the transgender community). I just wish that they actually knew what we needed. We need protection. We need to know that we can't be fired for being transgender. We need to know that we can sue for discrimination. We need to have more education and more awareness and public services for transgendered people. We need to make an environment where transgendered people feel comfortable coming forward." About the economic impact... North Carolina Rep. Paul Stam says criticisms of the measure from outside the state are empty threats that won't have a negative economic impact. Stam : "When we passed our marriage amendment four and a half years ago, we had the same attention. (People said) businesses would flee, people wouldn't live here. Since then, we've gone from the back of the pack in the nation, now we're the second fastest economy in job growth. We're ranked right at the top in site selection, so it will have about as much effect as it did four and a half years ago. I feel somewhat sorry for these big company CEOs, because they get bullied by people, maybe in New York, who come to their stockholder meetings. But it has nothing to do with what happens on the ground in North Carolina." Cox : "This (a provision in the law that says public agencies can provide single-stall bathrooms for special circumstances) is assuming that in a state that is already fighting to bring in business to garner revenue, all these government buildings are going to somehow magically have enough money to build, designate and create single-stall restrooms." About birth certificates and gender... Stam : "In North Carolina, you can have your birth certificate changed if you do reassignment surgery. It has been reported several places that we said it's your sex as designated at birth (that government agencies will use to define who can use bathrooms or changing facilities). And that is not correct. ... It's not what you are at birth. It's based on your birth certificate, which can be changed." Cox : "It's not just that easy. First of all, the gender on your birth certificate, whether or not you can change it is determined by the state in which you were born, not the state in which you reside. I reside in North Carolina. My birth certificate was issued in the state of New York. So my birth certificate and the gender changing is determined by those state laws. Not every state in the country even will allow you to change the gender. Some states will allow you to only amend the gender. Also, every state has rules and criteria. Some require you to have a letter from a plastic surgeon that states that you have undergone sexual reassignment surgery and removal of your reproductive organs for your born gender. Some require a letter from a psychologist staying that you've been diagnosed as having gender identity issues, and that you identify in that. So he is correct in that you could just change it. But that assumes that you were born in a state that allows you to change your gender, and that you have already completed all of the steps that that state requires you to go through in order to change the gender on your birth certificate."

MUST WATCH (5 Videos) Manziel's girlfriend: 'He hit me a couple of times' Manziel's ex files domestic violence complaint Quarterback Johnny Manziel enters treatment Johnny Manziel: Starting QB 'Johnny Football' goes viral in new ad Story highlights "Johnny will certainly plead 'not guilty,'" Manziel's lawyer says Former girlfriend says Manziel hit her January 30 Drew Rosenhaus was 2nd agent in 2 months to fire Manziel as a client (CNN) A Texas grand jury has indicted free agent quarterback and 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel on an assault charge, according to Dallas County court records. Manziel's former girlfriend, Colleen Crowley, accused the former NFL quarterback of restraining, hitting and threatening her during an alleged assault on January 30. She says in an affidavit that Manziel grabbed her by the hair and hit her, causing her to lose her hearing in one ear. Manziel, 23, has denied hitting Crowley. The indictment accuses Manziel of "intentionally and knowingly and recklessly (causing) bodily injury to" Crowley. The NFL also is investigating the incident. Manziel could face a league-imposed suspension if he is found to have violated the personal conduct policy. Read More Jim Darnell, an attorney for Manziel, said his client respected the grand jury's decision but said the panel heard only what the district attorney presented in a closed hearing. "Johnny will certainly plead 'not guilty' and we believe the evidence will support that plea. Out of respect for Ms. Crowley, we will not try the case in the press. We do, however, believe that Johnny will be acquitted at the conclusion of the case," he said in a statement. "Scared for my life" In the affidavit, Crowley says she was with Manziel at an upscale hotel in Dallas early on the morning of January 30. She says Manziel threw her on the bed and restrained her, preventing her from leaving the room. Crowley said she was still restrained as Manziel led her to the hotel's valet, where she cried: "Please don't let him take me. I'm scared for my life ." Johnny Manziel timeline The valet didn't know what to do and allowed the pair to leave, according to the affidavit. Crowley and Manziel then drove to Crowley's car. They both got in -- against her will, Crowley says -- but she jumped out and hid behind bushes. "He grabbed me by my hair and threw me back into the car and got back in himself. He hit me with his open hand on my left ear for jumping out of the car. I realized immediately that I could not hear out of that ear, and I still cannot today, two days later," the affidavit reads. Crowley says she hit Manziel several times while still afraid for her life. They then left Dallas for her apartment in Fort Worth. During the ride, Manziel allegedly threatened to kill both himself and her. The fight continued at the apartment, where Manziel allegedly smashed Crowley's phone, and she pulled a knife out of her knife block and advanced toward him, according to the affidavit. He fled. From early promise to a downward spiral Manziel entered the national spotlight as a redshirt freshman at Texas A;M, leading the Aggies to a 29-24 upset win against No. 1 Alabama in November 2012. The next month, he made history as the first freshman to win the Heisman Trophy , college football's most prestigious award. Johnny Manziel's agent Drew Rosenhaus: Go to rehab The Browns traded up to select Manziel 22nd overall in the 2014 NFL draft. While he showed flashes of promise, he ultimately couldn't retain the starting quarterback job. Last season, Manziel appeared in nine games for the Browns, starting six. He threw for 1,500 yards and seven touchdowns and five interceptions. He rushed for 230 yards. Manziel was cut by the Browns on March 11, two days after the start of the 2016 NFL calendar year. He had been signed with the team through 2017 before he was released. This criminal charge is the latest in a string of events that leave Manziel's NFL career in doubt. In February 2015, Brad Beckworth, a friend and adviser to Manziel and his family, said in a statement that the quarterback had entered a treatment facility the previous month. Manziel was at Caron, an alcohol and drug treatment facility in Pennsylvania. Johnny Manziel cut by Cleveland Browns "I owe private apologies to a lot of people that I disappointed but a very public one to the Browns organization and the fans that I let down," Manziel said in a statement April 17, 2015, after leaving rehab. "I take full responsibility for my actions and it's my intention to work very hard to regain everyone's trust and respect." But that started to unravel . On October 12, dashcam video showed a police officer pulling up to Manziel and Crowley, who were parked on the side of the road, telling them of "numerous calls" about their speeding BMW. Crowley told police that Manziel hit her several times to prevent her from leaving the car. However, she downplayed the incident. "I don't want to make a big deal," she told an officer. No charges were filed. On January 2, according to CNN affiliate WOIO-TV, North Olmsted, Ohio, police cited Manziel for driving with expired license plates. They had expired on September 20. Manziel was driving the same car when police questioned him on the side of the road in October, the TV station said. Manziel missed the Browns game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on January 3. According to an ESPN report, he was in Las Vegas that weekend in disguise and identified himself as "Billy." "Behavior will not be tolerated" Ahead of the start of the 2016 league year, before Manziel was released, new Browns head coach Hue Jackson said Manziel's future as a member of the Browns would be addressed soon. "I think it's really important that obviously there (were) some people involved in this situation that happened, and I feel very bad about those things, as they do happen," Jackson had said on February 24 at the NFL Combine in Indianapolis. "But I want to make sure we all understand that that behavior will not be tolerated as we move forward. And that's all I want to say about it. I want to leave it at that. Our organization is going to take a stand, and we're going to move on from those kind of situations as we move forward." Johnny Manziel case sent to district attorney Manziel has continued to party following his release, catching TMZ's cameras multiple times . And for the second time in a little more than two months, an agent fired Manziel as a client. Prominent agent Drew Rosenhaus said in a statement on April 13 that he has "terminated the standard representation with Johnny Manziel in the hopes of helping him get the treatment I believe he needs." Johnny Manziel's ex says she feared for her life "I have informed him that if he takes the immediate steps I have outlined for him that I will rescind the termination and continue to represent him," Rosenhaus said. "Otherwise the termination will become permanent. There is a five-day window for me to rescind the termination. I'm hoping he takes the necessary steps to get his life back on track." After the five-day window, that termination became permanent. Erik Burkhardt previously fired Manziel in early February. Nike also has dropped Manziel.

MUST WATCH Meeting gets heated over police shooting 01:12 Story highlights Justice Department, city officials announced review of police department Monday The review was sought after police shot and killed Mario Woods, 26, on December 2 Investigators will look at use of force policies and stops and searches (CNN) The Justice Department and San Francisco officials on Monday announced a review of the city's police department training and practices. The review by the Justice Department's Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS. office comes about two months after city police shot and killed a young African-American man, The shooting, captured on video, prompted widespread community complaints and unruly public meetings at which people demanded the police chief resign. The review is expected to take about two years to complete and will examine police operations, training, accountability, stops and searches and use of force, acting U.S. Attorney Brian Stretch said. Community members, rank-and-file officers, command staff, police commissioners and others who interact with the police will be interviewed. "The review will examine whether racial and ethnic disparities exist with respect to enforcement actions taken and not taken by the San Francisco Police Department," Stretch said. 'This is about building trust' Read More "This is about building trust and confidence in the community," said Ronald Davis of the COPS office. Some local law enforcement sources in San Francisco were dismissive of the planned COPS review, saying much more was needed in the wake of the shooting and a texting scandal made public last year in which officers sent homophobic and racist messages to one another. "It's not a real investigation," said a San Francisco law enforcement source familiar with the matter. "It's window dressing," added another. Stretch said Mayor Edwin Lee, Police Chief Greg Suhr, other city officials and community members requested federal involvement after officers fatally shot Mario Woods, 26, on December 2. San Francisco protesters decry police shooting caught in graphic videos 'Our city has grappled with a crisis' in a letter addressed to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, the mayor wrote: "In the past few weeks, our city has grappled with a crisis all too common in so many other American cities -- the dissolution of trust between communities of color and law enforcement -- following the death of a young black man shot and killed by police officers. ... "We want to throw our doors open, inviting transparency and accountability. We seek answers, not just to the facts of Mr. Wood's case, but also answers about how as a police department and a city we can build deeper, stronger trust between law enforcement and the communities they're sworn to protect," he said. Suhr said he welcomed the review, noting "the trust of many in San Francisco was broken" after the shooting. Stretch said a separate federal investigation into the Woods shooting will not be ordered at this point. The local district attorney will investigate the shooting and the Justice Department will review the findings. The Justice Department could launch a civil rights case if it's considered warranted, Stretch said. San Francisco mayor asks feds to look at police shooting of Mario Woods Five officers fired on Mario Woods In the videos of the Woods shooting, a barrage of gunfire reverberates in the Bayview neighborhood of San Francisco as a man, surrounded by a sea of police officers, is shot and killed. In a statement, San Francisco police laid out their version of events, saying officers first confronted Woods because a witness identified him as the attacker in a stabbing earlier in the afternoon. Police said Woods refused numerous demands to drop a knife and was a danger to others. Despite being struck with police bean bag rounds and pepper spray, Woods, still armed with a knife, attempted to walk away. An officer moved to block him from fleeing, police said.

Live on TV: Alarm interrupts famous morning anchors Ripa: Social media can be cruel for kids Kelly Ripa gets personal about Sandy Story highlights Ripa: It's about "respect in the workplace" It's about the reaction to her reaction (CNN) When Kelly Ripa returned to the set of "Live! With Kelly and Michael" after a four-day absence, her first words were "Our long national nightmare is over ." Let's hope so. Because what has played out over our airwaves the last couple of days is more than some petty office drama writ large. It's about "much greater conversation" across the country, as Ripa said Tuesday morning; it's "about communication and consideration and, most importantly, respect in the workplace." But first, let's take a step back: The switcheroo Read More For almost five years, Ripa and Michael Strahan over-shared and joked and invited viewers into their lives. It's why we were easily drawn in to a routine and a relationship with them. Then came the news that Strahan is leaving his position with "Live!" and joining "Good Morning America" as a full-time host. The ABC brass kept the news from Ripa until it was announced. 27 photos: Great TV hosts 27 photos: Great TV hosts What does it take to be a good TV host?

It's not as easy as it looks. Here are others who have been great at a sometimes underrated job. Hide Caption 1 of 27 27 photos: Great TV hosts Dick Clark, seen here in 1957, was the model of a good TV host. He readily gave up the stage and dance floor to "American Bandstand" visitors, oversaw "The $10,000 Pyramid" and its relations, and appeared on countless music and entertainment specials before he died in 2012.

The reaction Ripa's response to the news was justifiable. Would you want to be the last to know if you were an integral part of a project's success?

The context JUST WATCHED Kelly Ripa returns to 'Live' Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Kelly Ripa returns to 'Live' 01:32 Ripa has been at the helm of "Live!" since she came on alongside Regis Philbin in 2001. CNN's media critic Brian Stelter says Ripa feels "disrespected" by Disney-ABC Television Group president Ben Sherwood, because her show often feels like a second priority behind the network's crown jewel, "GMA" (aka Strahan's new home). Also, her treatment at the hands of TV execs isn't a one-off. 'GMA' at 40: Untold story of how the morning show war began "Think about Barbara Walters or Deborah Norville on the Today Show, or Ann Curry more recently on the Today Show," Stelter says. Curry, the most recent example, was forced off NBC's "Today Show: in 2012 in a messy, public ousting that fueled endless gossip and speculation about the show's de facto star Matt Lauer. This dynamic did not escape the attention of #TeamRipa supporters who saw Ripa's retaliation as the actions of a strong woman asserting her place. The other side To be sure, one has to look at it from the #TeamStrahan angle. He's had a full plate of work since joining "Live!" in 2011. In addition to co-hosting, the former NFL star also appeared on "GMA" and made cross-country trips for his position as an analyst for "Fox NFL Sunday Night," which films in Los Angeles. Strahan supporters say he had to do what he had to do for the sake of his career. In a professional setting, co-workers don't owe each other explanations of their decisions, they say.

The report, obtained by CNN affiliate KRON , says at least two shots hit the 26-year-old in the head and six hit him in the back. JUST WATCHED Report: Mario Woods shot 21 times in San Francisco Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Report: Mario Woods shot 21 times in San Francisco 01:00 Woods' December 2 death, which was captured in several cell phone videos, sparked protests of excessive police force, calls for change and a Justice Department review . Police have said Woods was a suspect in a stabbing that occurred earlier that day. "Fearing serious injury or death," police said officers opened fire after Woods refused numerous demands to drop a knife. They shot bean bags and pepper spray at him first, according to police, but those methods failed to stop him. The autopsy report lists 21 gunshot wounds, five injuries from "less than lethal" firearm rounds and six injuries likely caused by shrapnel. It also says Woods had methamphetamine, THC and antidepressants in his bloodstream. Read More "Multiple gunshot wounds" caused Woods' death, the report says. Police: Autopsy corroborates investigation In a statement responding to the autopsy report Thursday, police acknowledged that the shooting had shaken many residents' trust in the department. "It is difficult for anyone to watch videos of the shooting. Similarly, it is equally as difficult to read the Medical Examiner's report," the statement said. "That said, newly released information in the autopsy report appears to corroborate facts gathered by investigators in the aftermath of this tragic incident." Three independent investigations are underway, the department said, and the autopsy report "will be an important component" of all of them. Videos show barrage of gunfire In the videos of the Woods shooting, a barrage of gunfire reverberates in the Bayview neighborhood of San Francisco as a man, surrounded by a sea of police officers, is shot and killed. Police say five officers involved in the shooting have been placed on administrative leave. In January, San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee asked the Justice Department to investigate Woods' death. "In the past few weeks, our city has grappled with a crisis all too common in so many other American cities -- the dissolution of trust between communities of color and law enforcement -- following the death of a young black man shot and killed by police officers," Lee wrote in a letter to U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch. "We want to throw our doors open, inviting transparency and accountability. We seek answers, not just to the facts of Mr. Wood's case, but also answers about how as a police department and a city we can build deeper, stronger trust between law enforcement and the communities they're sworn to protect." Demonstrations over the shooting have continued for months, including a sign held up by a backup dancer after Beyonce's Super Bowl halftime performance Sunday, KRON reported . Protesters are calling for the officers to face criminal charges. Some have called for the police chief's resignation. "Somebody keeps saying we're trying to build, renew our trust with them," protester Bishop King said at a demonstration earlier this week, according to KRON. "I ain't never trusted the police in my life." CNN's Andy Rose, Dana Ford, Paul Vercammen and Artemis Moshtaghian contributed to this report.

After a humiliating defeat on Mega Tuesday , he finally bailed out -- closing down his campaign with an emotional speech that begged Republicans not to "surrender" to anger and fear. They almost did: Donald Trump scored big victories across the country and added hugely to his delegate count. But John Kasich's victory in Ohio may have prevented his coronation. And so the baton is passed: we have a new contender for second place. Clinton beating Sanders but he's no loser By Sally Kohn, CNN Political Commentator Hillary Clinton may be winning the Democratic nomination but that doesn't mean Bernie Sanders has lost, writes Sally Kohn.

The confusion that's driving support for Trump By Tiziana Dearing At some level, the 2016 presidential race has stopped being a presidential race and become a fight about who we are as a country, writes Tiziana Dearing. It's getting harder to believe Trump can be beaten By Timothy Stanley Timothy Stanley: The evolving narrative of "Trump can be beaten" is getting a little tired. The GOP may have to settle for him as its nominee Obama pats himself on the back over foreign policy By Frida Ghitis Frida Ghitis: Obama thinks highly of himself, as he should, but lacks the humility to fully see others' views and recognize his mistakes on Syria Trump rallies pose major challenge for police, security officials By Juliette Kayyem, CNN National Security Analyst Juliette Kayyem says an intricate series of precautions by law enforcement can lessen the threat of violence at political rallies like those of Donald Trump Defend Donald Trump's right to free speech America, wake up to the Trump menace Trump rally arrest: Botched in two ways By Danny Cevallos, CNN Legal Analyst Danny Cevallos: Officers should have arrested the guy who threw the punch right on the spot Reckless driving: The Hillary, Bernie blowup over autos By David Axelrod, CNN Senior Political Commentator David Axelrod: Though Clinton's auto bailout attack on Sanders was a misfire, Sanders' bailout votes are worth questioning Two Donald Trumps, or two Ben Carsons?

Does the school owe her a job? Danny Cevallos explains. America, wake up to the Trump menace The law that made Clinton's candidacy thinkable By Gillian Thomas Gillian Thomas says that without Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, fairness for women in the workplace would be a fantasy Trump's view on Islam is frightening By Haroon Moghul Haroon Moghul: Do you think that once you open the door to this hate, it'll stop with Muslims? The big difference between Clinton and Sanders Will U.S. democracy commit suicide? Is Donald Trump another Barry Goldwater?

ISIS is losing the war By Douglas A. Ollivant The Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, (ISIS), as an organized military force in Iraq and Syria, is losing—even losing badly, says Douglas A.

Nancy Reagan's real role in the Reagan White House By David Gergen, CNN Senior Political Analyst She was enforcer, protector of her husband's energy and image--but mainly she was the thing every President needs: a "First Friend." Is Sanders' 'Excuse me, I'm talking' line sexist? By Peggy Drexler Peggy Drexler says Sanders was responding to Clinton the way any candidate would; it's wrong to reduce this to sexism and view Clinton just in gender terms A hidden reality: Violence against women in politics Madeleine Albright When a woman participates in politics, she should be putting her dreams for the future on the line, not her dignity and not her life, says Madeleine Albright. Trump's 'size' is now a campaign issue. How's Hillary Clinton supposed to deal with that? By Sally Kohn, CNN Political Commentator There's one candidate in the 2016 presidential election who isn't likely to make dick jokes: Hillary Clinton. That's because she doesn't have a penis. Breaking the cycle of poverty, one woman at a time By Connie Britton A few years ago in Ethiopia, I met a young girl named Helen, who had recently given birth to a daughter. Debate coach: Who won the debate? By Todd Graham Debate coach Todd Graham grades Clinton and Sanders on their ability to seal deal with supporters and steal opponent's voters on issues from fracking to race. Nancy Reagan, a larger-than-life first lady A soldier's view on Trump By Mark Hertling At debate, candidate said he could compel soldiers to ignore oath of service, perform illegal acts.

Cupp, who's no fan of Donald Trump, thinks he got this issue right and Ted Cruz got it wrong Laws to regulate which bathroom people can use are ridiculous she says SE Cupp is the author of "Losing Our Religion: The Liberal Media's Attack on Christianity," co-author of "Why You're Wrong About the Right" and a columnist at the New York Daily News. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. (CNN) It seems smug to put it this way, but I will give Donald Trump credit for one thing: bathrooms. It's not an undercut. On the issue of legislating transgender bathrooms --and maybe only on this issue, if you ask me -- Trump is completely right, and his rival Ted Cruz completely wrong. The billionaire said Thursday on the "Today" show on NBC that, "There have been very few complaints the way it is. People go, they use the bathroom that they feel is appropriate. There has been so little trouble, and the problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic punishment that they're taking. So I would say that's probably the best way. What Trump, Carson don't get about Harriet Tubman Cruz, in turn, attacked Trump's view , telling Glenn Beck: "it is simply crazy and the idea that grown men would be allowed alone in a bathroom with little girls -- you don't need to be a behavioral psychologist to realize bad things can happen, and any prudent person wouldn't allow that." I'm not sure how seriously Trump has contemplated this very controversial, thorny issue. Suffice it to say, it's likely that his position, which is that transgender people like Caitlin Jenner should be able to use whichever gender bathroom they want, was not informed by any deep philosophical contemplation of free societies or identity politics, nor by the limits of the Constitution or the role of the states. Read More (Again, not being smug ... I'm confident this is the case because when pressed later on his position, he walked it back slightly to say that this should be decided by the states and not the federal government, which is perplexing since the controversial laws we're talking about were passed ... by states.) Rather, it's likely that, like most of Trump's "policies," this one was cooked up in about two minutes, in between a bite of NY strip steak and a swig of Sprite, and is based on nothing more than the chaotic machinations of Trump's bombastic inner monologue. Choosing vice presidential candidates needs to start soon (Opinion) It should matter -- when picking a plumber or a President -- how a person arrives at a conclusion. And that Trump spit out his verdict with the careful contemplation of a carnival fortune teller machine should matter. But regardless, it's important to acknowledge when even the least responsible thought process still produces the right conclusion. Maybe that tells us something about Trump's gut, or his worldview or his humanity. Let transgender people achieve American dream (Opinion) So forgetting how he got here, let's acknowledge that Trump's position is sane, logical and -- perhaps most notably -- divorced from the cultural persuasions of either his adopted political party or many of his supporters. For one, on its face, laws that prohibit a transgendered male-to-female from using a public women's restroom are totally unenforceable. Trump's famously overly-simplified approach to issues -- Build a wall! Bomb the s--t out of them! Ban them all! -- is probably helpful here. Are we going to arrest people for choosing the wrong restroom? Are we going to post a police officer outside every public restroom? Are they going to look for Adam's apples or breasts? Or will guards ask outright what a person's gender is? This is, in a word, absurd. For another -- and this is the argument Trump would make if he were at all fluent in conservative political thought -- it is entirely UN-conservative to essentially grow the government to support an outsized Big Brother police state that will monitor our bathroom trips. This is the stuff of Orwell, not Locke. Ted Cruz is the real radical in GOP race (Opinion) It's also a solution in search of a problem, as Trump noted. Is there an epidemic of trans agitators exploiting their adopted genders to invade women's restrooms and do untoward stuff to young girls? If so, I missed all the paranoia over non-trans men sneaking into women's bathrooms, and doing untoward stuff to young girls. What is to stop any man from walking into a public ladies' room in the first place? The arguments for such legislation are, in short, entirely fabricated, a cultural and political invention used to stoke public fear, pledge fealty to a cartoonish, far-right totem of morality, and stand athwart some imagined political correctness. This, it should be noted, is how Ted Cruz arrived at his conclusion. And that matters, too. The real question is what Trump's supporters will think. Do they agree that Caitlin Jenner should be able to pop into a stall next to their daughters? Or do they think these laws are right -- and Trump is wrong?

Eighteen protesters were arrested on "building violations" charges and others were arrested and accused of staying in the building after it closed for the evening, according to Officer Scott Cameron of the General Assembly Police.

Jackson said he is hoping people will see that this bill really is about discrimination, and says that those who don't are not fully reading it. "North Carolina is so much better than this," he said.

Opinion: Trump is right on transgender bathroom laws Walk-back? Last month, a federal lawsuit was filed against the North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and other state officials over the law. Earlier this month, McCrory said he'd signed an executive order "to protect privacy and equality." "After listening to people's feedback for the past several weeks on this issue, I have come to the conclusion that there is a great deal of misinformation, misinterpretation, confusion, a lot of passion and frankly, selective outrage and hypocrisy, especially against the great state of North Carolina," he said. "But based upon this feedback, I am taking action to affirm and improve the state's commitment to privacy and equality." Opponents of the law said Tuesday that the governor's executive order was too little, too late. CNN's Leigh Waldman and Christine Sever contributed to this report. Breaking the trans glass ceiling Story highlights A transgender teen threatens legal action over his suspension The case is believed to be the first test of a new ruling upholding transgender rights (CNN) The pep rally was underway as a South Carolina high school student headed to the bathroom. A teacher trailed him. The student is transgender, and she wanted to make sure he used "the right one," he said. To him, the right one is the boys' bathroom, which he says he has used since seventh grade without incident. Then, in his senior year, school administrators told him he had to use the girls' restroom, he said. They also gave him the option to use the nurse's restroom. When he exited the bathroom, the teacher did not say anything to him, but he knew from the "exasperated" look on her face that he was in trouble. The next morning, he was called into the vice principal's office said told he was suspended for one day for using the boys' bathroom. 17 photos: Transgender identity in the news 17 photos: Transgender identity in the news It was rare for black models like Tracey "Africa" Norman to break into the cutthroat lily-white world of modeling in the 1970s.

"Teachers should never be following students to the bathroom unless they reek of cigarette smoke or alcohol." We're not Caitlyn Jenner: Stories of transgender transitions He asked to be identified as R. because, like many transgender people, he does not want to publicly identify as transgender. He simply wants to spend his days in the skin he feels comfortable in. Instead of returning to school less than three months before graduation, he enrolled in online classes for fear of being "outed." Now, he's threatening legal action against Horry County Schools to make sure other transgender students don't have to experience what he went through. A case to test transgender rights CNN could not independently confirm the student's claims, which were laid out in a demand letter from the Oakland, California-based Transgender Law Center sent Thursday on R.'s behalf. It appears to be the first test of last week's appeals court decision that upheld transgender students' rights to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity. Transgender teen: 'I'm not the Obamacare kid anymore' In that case, the Fourth Circuit of Appeals ruled on April 19 in favor of Gavin Grimm, a Virginia teen who claimed that the Gloucester County School Board violated Title IX , a federal law banning sex discrimination in schools, by preventing him from using boys' restrooms in school. The decision is binding on nine federal district courts in Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia, North Carolina and South Carolina, meaning judges are compelled to follow it as precedent. It remains to be seen how lower courts in the conservative circuit will interpret the decision. In addition to school policy, it could impact legislation such as North Carolina's controversial law prohibiting transgender people from using public restrooms for the gender they identify with. The decision created an opportunity to show that similar school district policies within the circuit are just as unconstitutional as Gloucester's policy, said Ilona Turner, legal director of the Transgender Law Center. Horry County Schools Superintendent Rick Maxey would not comment specifically on the allegations but said the district is working to create a "welcoming environment." "The district maintains the privacy of all of its students," Maxey said in an email. "The district seeks to accommodate the individual needs of its transgender students in compliance with the law, including Title IX. We will continue our efforts to ensure a welcoming school environment for all students." The high cost of being transgender After R. was suspended in January, a representative for the schools told CNN affiliate WMBF that the district does not have a specific policy on bathroom use for transgender students. The representative said the district makes accommodations based on individual needs and schools. The Transgender Law Center's letter asks the school district to remove the suspension from R.'s record. It also asks the district to give transgender students access to facilities that match their gender identity and to ensure that all school staff respect the gender identity of transgender students. If the school does not comply within a week, center officials might file a complaint with the Department of Education, which enforces Title IX. Another option is to file a lawsuit in federal court, similar to the Grimm case. Target takes stand on transgender bathroom controversy "It's a very dangerous thing when we create these kinds of policies and laws intended to single out transgender people. They have the effect of policing everyone and placing gender under scrutiny," Turner said. "Anyone who walks into a women's restroom who has short hair or appears less than totally feminine may have the police called on them or asked for their birth certificate." 'It was hard to understand' For years, it appeared that the school was on board with R.'s gender identity, said the teen and his mother, who asked to go by Lynne. Though he was born a girl, he resisted wearing dresses and began to show signs of identifying as a boy when he was 4, Lynne said. It was difficult for her to accept initially, especially in a conservative community where traditional gender roles reign, but in the end she just wanted her son to be happy, she said. "It was hard to understand what transgender was because I had never heard of it before," she said. "I had to get to place where I understood what that was and what it means." North Carolina bathroom law: Uncomfortable encounters By seventh grade, R. was shopping for clothes from the boys' section. Based on his appearance, girls in middle school began to complain when he used the girls' room. His family reached a decision with school administrators to use the boys' room to make everyone more comfortable, his mother said. Since then, he has used the boys' room at school and in public places, Lynne said. Except for family and a few close friends, people at school knew him as a boy, until October. That's when a teacher found out he was born a girl and complained to administrators about him using the boys' room, the law center's letter states. His mother met with school administrators and told them they had to let her son use the bathroom according to his gender identity. They disagreed and said that he must use the girls' room or that he could use the nurse's room, the letter says. Cruz knocks Trump's position on transgender bathroom law Using the girls' room was not an option, he said. He did not want to be outed after years of living as a boy. He chose the nurse's room to make it less obvious, but it soon proved onerous: The nurse's bathroom is on the first floor and most of his classes were on the second or third floors, he said. Each time he went to the bathroom, he lost about 10 minutes in classroom time. Occasionally, to save time, he disobeyed the mandate and used the boys' room to save time. "It was a lot of walking. I was always worried about how long I was out of the classroom," he said. The worries turned into panic attacks at school, which were exacerbated by teachers who started using female pronouns to refer to him, according to the demand letter. Opinion: Trump is right on transgender bathroom laws The January confrontation outside the bathroom was the tipping point, Lynne said. Instead of returning to school after the suspension, he enrolled in online courses. It was no longer just about the panic attacks or the inconvenience of using the nurse's bathroom, his mother said. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter . After years of treating him like a boy, the school was effectively outing him, she said. "I was mad. I was angry, very angry that they would treat my child that way after all these years," she said. "I don't understand why it's important to dictate which bathroom they're allowed to use. I don't understand why people feel the need to control other people's lives." Incidentally, R.'s progress in school has improved since he started classes online through the state, he said. His grades are better, and he's on track to finish classes ahead of time. Regardless of whether the school grants his request, he feels a duty to future students to fix the situation. "That's kind of my job, as a senior at the school," he said. "People should be able to use the bathroom in peace without being policed for using the right one or the wrong one." 10 photos: Know your identity terms New terms are entering the cultural lexicon as people endeavor to codify their sexual orientation or gender.

Who are Abu Sayyaf? 'Cold-blooded murder' Speaking on Monday, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Ridsdel's death was "an act of cold-blooded murder and responsibility rests squarely with the terrorist group who took him hostage." Trudeau said Canada condemns the "brutality" of this "unnecessary death," and expressed his "deepest condolences" to Ridsdel's family and friends.

"There will be no let up in the determined efforts ... to neutralize these lawless elements and thwart further threats to peace and security," the Armed Forces of the Philippines and the Philippine National Police said in a joint statement. How terrorist beheadings brutalize us all Other hostages Ridsdel was among four people abducted September 21 at the Oceanview Resort on Samal Island, which lies off the coast of the major southern island of Mindanao, Philippine officials said . This part of the southern Philippines is home to Abu Sayyaf, an Islamist militant group that's been linked to al Qaeda and ISIS . The separatist group has at times preyed on foreigners in recent years, taking them hostage to further its aims. Hostages Robert Hall and Marites Flor The situation has drawn growing political attention in the country. Earlier this month, one lawmaker called for Abu Sayyaf to be a topic in the country's next presidential debate. In addition to Ridsdel, Norwegian national Kjartan Sekkingstad, Canadian national Robert Hall and Filipina Marites Flor were also taken hostage, according to officials . In a statement , Norwegian Foreign Minister Borge Brende said Norway would "continue our ongoing efforts to find a solution for the remaining hostages." Negotiations Last month Islamist militant group Abu Sayyaf released a video that appeared to show Ridsdel and the other captives pleading for their lives , as armed masked men stood behind them. One of the masked men in the video had threatened to "do something terrible against these captives" if the captors' demands -- which included ransom -- were not met.

The Philippine government maintains a no-ransom policy , and the Canadian and Norwegian governments "were not going to pay ransom," Rae said. "These poor people ... were caught in a maelstrom." Rommel Banlaoi, executive director at the Philippine Institute for Peace, Violence and Terrorism Research, said that the killing would help boost Abu Sayyaf's leverage. "The group showed that it does not bluff and does not merely strike fear. They showed that they have the capacity for violence if their demands are not met." Banlaoi added that money has been a motivator for the group's activities. "Their motivation is money, so that they could generate funds to buy the loyalty of local communities."

(CNN) Donald Trump can't lock up the Republican nomination Tuesday -- but he can counter his two opponents' divide-and-conquer strategy and reassert his dominance in the race by running the table in five states. Hillary Clinton , meanwhile, could finally start to see the finish line. If she's able to handily defeat Bernie Sanders , she could leave the Vermont senator with no real path to the Democratic nomination. 6 photos: Who's running for president? 6 photos: Who's running for president?

Hide Caption 5 of 6 6 photos: Who's running for president? Sen. Bernie Sanders , an independent from Vermont who caucuses with Democrats, announced his run in an email to supporters on April 30. He has said the United States needs a "political revolution" of working-class Americans to take back control of the government from billionaires. "This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists," Sanders said at a rally in Vermont on May 26. Hide Caption 6 of 6 Nightcap: Ted Cruz and John Kasich join forces | Sign up There are 172 Republican delegates at stake, and 384 up for grabs on the Democratic side, when Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island vote Tuesday in the "Acela primary," named after the high-speed train that shuttles commuters up and down the East Coast. Here are five things to watch in Tuesday's contests: Read More How big is Trump's win? The anti-Trump alliance is finally in place. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich , Trump's last two foes still standing, have unveiled a divide-and-conquer strategy that will see Cruz focus his efforts on denying Trump a victory in Indiana, a key contest a week away, while Kasich campaigns in Oregon and New Mexico. Opinion: Can Cruz-Kasich strategy really stop Trump? His opponents' targets might have shifted, but make no mistake: A sweep would be an important victory for Trump -- and a big step toward the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the GOP's nomination. The Cruz-Kasich alliance only came together, after Trump crushed the competition in New York and then made clear to his opponents that they had no real room in Pennsylvania, Maryland, Connecticut, Delaware and Rhode Island. Trump's go-to complaint now is that the GOP establishment's only chance of slowing his roll to the nomination is to deny the democratic process and steal it from him. Of Cruz, Trump told a crowd in West Chester, Pennsylvania, on Monday: "So we're going to pick a guy that over a year got creamed, right? Got creamed. So you explain how that's done. You would have a revolt!" Pennsylvania's wild card delegates could make or break Donald Trump Whether Trump eventually racks up the delegate count he needs or not, big wins in Tuesday's contests could drive that point home. Just as important, even with Cruz and Kasich now finally on the same page in an attempt to stop Trump , more big victories could give pause to donors to the #NeverTrump movement. Clinton looks to lock things up She won't hit the 2,383 delegates she needs to clinch the Democratic nomination Tuesday. But Hillary Clinton could come close enough to effectively decide the Democratic nomination if she wins big across the Northeast. Clinton tried to nudge Sanders a bit Monday night in a town hall on MSNBC, noting that she has a much bigger lead right now than then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama held at this stage over her in 2008. Opinion: Can Sanders' millennials switch to Clinton? "It was so much closer than the race right now between me and Senator Sanders," she said. Maryland poll: Clinton, Trump lead Clinton also said she's not buying the Sanders campaign's belief that it can catch her in the total vote count when Democrats in delegate-rich California head to the polls in June. "I am way ahead," Clinton said. "Look, I have the greatest respect for Sen. Sanders, but really, what he and his supporters are now saying just doesn't add up. I have 2.7 million more votes than he has. I have more than 250 more pledged delegates." Her win in the New York primary last week was a key moment as Clinton denied Sanders his last real opportunity to fundamentally alter the race. On Tuesday night, Clinton can solidify that victory and eliminate Sanders' path to the nomination. Will Sanders get any good news? We have been here before. After Clinton won big on Super Tuesday, she faltered in Michigan . And following her sweep of five big states on March 15, she watched Sanders reel off victories in six out of seven Western contests, slowing her momentum. On Tuesday night, Sanders hopes for a similar moment to reassert his standing in the race. Rhode Island looks like a good bet for Sanders, who has performed well in New England -- winning New Hampshire, Vermont and Maine and coming close in Massachusetts. 23 photos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlight 23 photos: Bernie Sanders in the spotlight U.S. Sen.

Hide Caption 23 of 23 Sanders: Path to nomination is not easy But he faces long odds in the other four states on Tuesday's calendar. It could be enough to end his chances at winning the Democratic nomination. Time is running out for Sanders, whose unexpected and meteoric rise has actually continued: He has now caught Clinton in national Democratic polls , and he has raised more money than she has in the campaign so far. However, those national polls don't mean much now that most states have already voted, leaving him just 12 more contests where he can win delegates after Tuesday. Clinton takes her foot off the gas on Sanders after New York win If he doesn't pull off miracles Tuesday, Sanders will wake up the next day with tough decisions to make about the direction he wants to take the movement he's led. Will he battle on through California in an attempt to narrow the delegate gap and turn the Democratic National Convention into a bitter battle that he stands little chance of winning? Or will he look to carve out a different role for himself in Democratic politics? What's up with Pennsylvania? The Keystone State is set for a chaotic night no matter how the immediate results pan out. That's because 54 of Pennsylvania's 71 directly elected delegates will enter the national convention unbound to any candidate. Voters in each of the state's 18 congressional districts will pick from a menu of names with no formal indication of whom they plan to support in Cleveland. To help their chances, the Cruz and Trump campaigns have sought out loyal supporters among the ranks of the delegate candidates and distributed those names to voters. 17 photos: Voices from the Rust Belt 17 photos: Voices from the Rust Belt Hide Caption 1 of 17 17 photos: Voices from the Rust Belt Dolores, 85, and Richard Peters, 84, have been married since 1954 and have lived in Tonawanda, New York, just north of Buffalo, for more than 60 years.

Both voted for President Barack Obama twice. Neither of them planned to vote in the New York primary this year, and they haven't made up their minds about the general election. Dolores Peters says that she likes John Kasich because he seems "down-to-earth" and "honest as the day is long" and that she would have a tough time choosing between Kasich and Hillary Clinton.

Ivancic voted for Obama in the 2008 general election and sat out four years later because he was unhappy with the president and the rest of the field.This year, he voted for Donald Trump and considers himself more a Republican than a Democrat. His No. 1 issue is the economy. "I can respect what he's built and what he's achieved. He's a businessman, and if you run our country like a business, it should run successfully," Ivancic says of Trump. "Trump speaks the truth.

The city had gone through such hard times, he says, that when the 2008 financial crisis hit, some in his community hardly felt it: "We didn't suffer because we'd been suffering for so long."

"It seems like Donald Trump has a better idea of trying to tighten things up so this ISIS thing doesn't hurt people," he said.

They have Trump signs in their front yard (and an extra one in their dining room "in case one of their friends needs one") and a bumper sticker on their Ford pickup. Both Grays have voted for Democrats and Republicans in the past. This year, they are inspired by Trump's promise of change. "He does say some things that are off the wall a little bit, but he's talking to the average person," Gary Gray said. "He's talking to people who haven't finished school."

Its beach was recently voted the No. 1 freshwater beach in the country, and the park is considered one of Erie's gems, drawing a flood of tourists in the summer to businesses like Candela's. He named his restaurants after his mother, Sara. "When I get tired, you think, well, you don't want anybody saying anything bad about your mother. So it gives you a little bit of extra energy," he said. Candela has not decided which presidential candidate he'll vote for this year, though as a business owner, one of his top priorities is to be able to do his job "with as little interference as possible." He says he understands both Trump's and Sanders' appeal. But, he added, "There's appeal, and there's reality. Can anybody in the system get a lot accomplished anymore?" Hide Caption 17 of 17 Resetting red and blue in the Rust Belt Still, state GOP rules do not bind those would-be delegates to what they tell the campaigns, or anyone else. How to become a Republican delegate In all, more than 160 hopefuls will appear on the ballot Tuesday, with the Cruz campaign pushing for two write-in candidates. Of the more than 135 people who spoke with CNN, about 25% say they'll support Trump, while another 42% say they'll back their congressional district's winner -- good news for Trump, who is poised to win the popular vote by a heavy margin. Twenty percent of respondents said they will support Ted Cruz, while 11% said they planned to remain uncommitted until a later date, possibly until the convention. None of the candidates told CNN they planned to support Kasich. Poll: Trump, Clinton dominate head of Pennsylvania primary The state's rules could make for a chaotic process of sorting out who's really won the state -- and nothing will be certain until the first ballot at the Republican National Convention, anyway, since all 54 of Tuesday night's delegate slot winners will be free to change their minds at any moment. Can Cruz and Kasich win delegates? It's all but certain that Trump will romp on Tuesday night. But Cruz and Kasich are hoping to at least pick off a few delegates. Cruz is eying Maryland as his best chance. The state awards 24 of its 38 delegates to the winners of congressional districts, three apiece. Cruz targeted the state's rural areas, hoping to win one or two of Maryland's eight districts. Ted Cruz and John Kasich: 2016 frenemies Still, Cruz's allies acknowledge Tuesday will be brutal. "Some of these states -- Connecticut, Rhode Island -- these are Rockefeller-type Republicans. They're not going to resonate with Cruz," state Sen. Michael Hough , the chairperson of Cruz's Maryland campaign told CNN . "Then in May, the map flips back." Cruz is already in Indiana, a state that votes May 3 and has 58 delegates up for grabs. Kasich, meanwhile, looks poised to pick up a few delegates in Rhode Island, which awards its 19 on a proportional basis -- and where Cruz might not reach the state's 10% threshold to qualify for any delegates. He also campaigned hard in Pennsylvania, despite its limited number of delegates available to be won on primary day. "We're going to have good results across these primaries. I'm very excited about what's going to happen tomorrow," Kasich said Monday in Philadelphia. CNN's Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.

The initial deliveries will be A320 family aircraft with the current engine option, but will begin transitioning to new engine option derivatives in late 2017. From Hamburg to Mobile The story of this first Airbus aircraft built in the U.S. begins on the other side of the pond. In early June 2015, the fuselage sections of the aircraft were shipped to the United States from Hamburg, Germany, together with 4,000 other parts. Some 40% of the aircraft was built with parts from U.S. suppliers, as well as the engines. 14 photos: Airplane seat patents 14 photos: Airplane seat patents Airline seat sizes – In the last few years, airline seats have been shrinking while passengers' waistlines have expanded.

Final assembly of the first aircraft began in mid-July 2015, when the main fuselage sections were placed in the transhipment hangar. There, the major component assemblies are sent to the final assembly line, which is divided into five work stations. The first station, known as Station 41, is where the forward and aft sections of the fuselage are joined. This is also where internal elements such as monuments and galleys are installed. 2016 in aviation: Profits, airport upgrades and the longest flight in the world The second, Station 40, is where the wings and the fuselage are joined. At the time when the final assembly line was inaugurated, the wing and fuselage mating works were underway and completed in October 2015. Immediately thereafter, the aircraft was sent to Station 35 where the airplane powers on its own. Vertical and horizontal tail planes are assembled here and the wings are completed. 5 photos: What's the big difference? 5 photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A320 vs Boeing 737 series – These two narrow-body, twin-engine, single-aisle planes are among the most common commercial jets in the world. To an amateur, it can be difficult to spot which is which given they're very similar in size. The secret is to look at the nose and tail shape. Hide Caption 1 of 5 5 photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A330 vs. Boeing 787 series – Again, these two wide-body twin-engine jets are similar in size but their nose shapes offer an easy hint.

Airbus A340 vs. Boeing 777 series – Though both planes are commonly used for long-haul flights, these wide-body jets differ dramatically in appearance. The Airbus A340 has four engines, while the Boeing 777 has two. Hide Caption 3 of 5 5 photos: What's the big difference? Airbus A350 vs. Boeing 777 series – This pairing is to become more relevant in the coming years given Airbus stopped producing the A340 in 2011.

The nose cone and radome are added here and landing gear functions are checked. Lighting, in-flight entertainment, and cabin pressurization systems are installed and tested here as well. The aircraft finally entered the final phase / flight line station, where engines are installed, along with final testing before the aircraft returns outside and is sent to the paint shop. Airbus hopes to launch hybrid passenger planes by 2030 Last October, Airbus announced plans to ramp up production of its A320 family of aircraft before the end of the decade. It was a move supported by record numbers of firm orders, amid strong global demand for the type. Airbus expects to increase the rate to 52 planes per month by 2018, supported by its final production lines in Germany, France, China, and the United States. Get set, ready... fly! Back on February 24, the nearly completed BluesMobile rolled out from the final assembly line, and was sent to the paint shop for to receive the JetBlue livery. The paint hangar has an area of 27,700 sq feet (2,574 square meters) and will be capable of painting all A320 family aircraft -- A318, A319, A320 and A321s equipped with sharklets and NEO options. The aircraft soared the skies for the first time last March 24, with test pilots Mark McCullins and Bruce Macdonald, flight test engineers Thierry Cros and Nick Picconi, and ground test engineers/cabin specialists Alexander Gentzsch and Mike Johns. The flight lasted three hours and 26 minutes, during which standard tests were performed on systems, engines and structure. The aircraft climbed as high as 39,000 feet (11,887 meters), Airbus said. Pilots performed dynamic flight checks and electrical system tests as the jetliner ascended to 31,000 feet (9,449 meters). 'Without Airbus, JetBlue wouldn't be JetBlue' "JetBlue received the honor of being the first U.S. delivery customer in large part to the partnership dating back to the beginning." JetBlue EVP Martin said. BluesMobile is JetBlue's 29th A321, of which 13 are "mint" configured, he said. It's the 130th A320 family aircraft to join the fleet. JetBlue's redesign - more legroom, HD screens, and Wi-Fi "Without Airbus, JetBlue wouldn't be JetBlue," Martin said. "The A321 core aircraft has been a success due to its lower seat costs and being a proven platform." said Martin. To date, JetBlue's A321 fleet has a 98% of dispatch reliability and averages 15 hours per day of utilization. Aboard the delivery flight AirwaysNews boarded Monday's delivery flight, which was commanded by Capt. Rick Smith. The flight's First Officer was Capt. Bart Robert, JetBlue's vice president of flight. Capt. Smith was joined on the flight deck by his father and wife, who flies as a flight attendant for JetBlue. How to snag a free flight on JetBlue The aircraft was delivered with a 190-seat "core configured" layout, with new ergonomic B/E Aerospace Pinnacle seats. In recent years, JetBlue has focused on keeping customers connected throughout their flights, including free gate-to-gate Fly-Fi high-speed Internet, high-definition seatback televisions, and in-seat power outlets with USB ports. All of these features will be offered on this A321. About the incorporation of this A321 to the fleet, Martin said the Fly-Fi and in-flight entertainment installation, which takes place at HAECO in Lake City, Florida, takes approximately 1-2 weeks. Dream of becoming a pilot? JetBlue wants you Martin expects that in 14 days, the aircraft will enter revenue service. He also announced that the first flight will start flying routes either at the airport in Orlando or Ft. Lauderdale.

The United States sent the F-22 Raptors to southeastern Europe two weeks after Russian fighter jets buzzed an American warship in the Baltic Sea. Officially it was for a NATO training exercise, part of the Rapid Response program showcasing how effectively and quickly U.S. fighter jets, crews and support can be moved to a forward operating base. The F-22s are known for speed and stealth. But it was also a show of strength for NATO allies on the Black Sea, where Russia is rapidly building up its military hardware. The F-22s are known for speed and stealth -- able to travel at twice the speed of sound and hard to spot on radar.

The transfer from RAF Lakenheath in Eastern England is strategically significant for NATO and its allies, because Constanta is on the Black Sea, close to the Ukrainian border, Crimea and Sevastopol, the home of Russia's Black Sea fleet. Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 and has continued military exercises in the area while saying it will spend $2.4 billion to upgrade its naval capacity.

Americans have also been annoyed by Russia recently, most notably with two Russian jets flying extremely close to the USS Donald Cook as it sailed on the Baltic Sea. The Cook "encountered multiple, aggressive flight maneuvers by Russian aircraft that were performed within close proximity of the ship," according to a statement by European Command earlier this month. One of the Russian jets flew within 30 feet of the Cook's ship superstructure, according to a U.S. official. 23 photos: In the U.S. Air Force fleet F-22 Raptor – The twin-engine F-22 stealth fighter, flown by a single pilot and armed with a 20mm cannon, heat-seeking missiles, radar-guided missiles and radar-guided bombs, can perform both air-to-air and air-to-ground missions.

We describe some of these technologies below. 1. Cookies. To enhance your online experience, we and our Partners use "cookies", "web beacons" or other tracking technologies. Cookies are text files placed in your computer's browser to store your preferences.

We also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to help us offer you products, content, offerings or services that may be of interest to you and to deliver relevant advertising when you visit this Service, a Turner Affiliate's Service, or when you visit other websites or applications. We or a third party platform with whom we work may place or recognize a unique cookie on your browser to enable you to receive customized content, offers, services or advertisements on our Services or other sites.

The cookies may be associated with de-identified demographic or other data linked to or derived from data you voluntarily have submitted to us (e.g., your email address) that we may share with a service provider solely in hashed, non-human readable form. We, our third party service providers, advertisers, advertising networks and platforms, agencies, or our Partners also may use cookies or other tracking technologies to manage and measure the performance of advertisements displayed on or delivered by or through the Turner Network and/or other networks or Services. This also helps us, our service providers and Partners provide more relevant advertising. 2. Syncing Cookies and Identifiers. We may work with our Partners (for instance, third party ad platforms) to synchronize unique, anonymous identifiers (such as those associated with cookies) in order to match our Partners' uniquely coded user identifiers to our own. We may do this, for instance, to enhance data points about a particular unique browser or device, and thus enable us or others to send ads that are more relevant, match Users to their likely product interests, or better synchronize, cap, or optimize advertising. 3.
